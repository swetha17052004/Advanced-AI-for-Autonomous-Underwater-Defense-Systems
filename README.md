Project Title & Description

NKPL-Underwater-Defense is a hybrid algorithm combining Neural networks, Kalman filtering, and Path Learning (RL-based planning) for autonomous underwater defense navigation.
It solves the challenge of safe and efficient underwater vehicle navigation in environments with obstacles, noise, and uncertainty, where traditional static planners like A* fail to adapt.

‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

The system integrates three core components that work together at runtime:

Reinforcement Learning (RL): Learns dynamic action policies for path optimization.

Kalman Filter: Filters noisy sonar/sensor measurements and provides accurate state estimation.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Processes raw sonar images or environment grids for obstacle detection and environmental awareness.

The workflow:

CNN extracts environment features from sonar-like input.

Kalman filter stabilizes the predicted state under noise.

RL agent receives the cleaned state and selects optimal actions (move left, right, forward, etc.).

Feedback loop continues until the goal is reached.
